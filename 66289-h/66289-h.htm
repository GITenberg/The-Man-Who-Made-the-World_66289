<p><i>Doctor Janishefsky sat in his office. Leaning back in a great leather
chair, hands folded. He had a reflective air and a well-trimmed goatee.
He hummed a few bars of&mdash;"It Ain't Whatcha Do, It's The Way Thatcha
Do It." He broke off and looked up with a kindly smile as the nurse
entered. Her name was Mudde.</i></p>

<p>NURSE MUDDE. Doctor, there is a man in the waiting room who says he
made the world.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Oh?</p>

<p>NURSE MUDDE. Shall I let him in?</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. By all means, Nurse Mudde. Show the man in.</p>

<p><i>Nurse Mudde left. A small man entered. He was five foot five wearing a
suit made for a man six foot five. His hands were near-hidden by the
sleeve ends, his trouser leg bottoms creased sharply at the shoe tops,
assuming the function of unattached spats. The shoes were virtually
invisible. As was the gentleman's mouth lurking behind a mustache of
mouselike proportions.</i></p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Won't you have a seat Mr....</p>

<p>SMITH. Smith. (<i>He sits</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Now.</p>

<p>(<i>They regard each other</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. My nurse tells me you made the world.</p>

<p>SMITH. Yes. (<i>In a confessional tone</i>) I did.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Settling back in his chair</i>) All of it?</p>

<p>SMITH. Yes.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. And everything in it?</p>

<p>SMITH. Take a little, give a little.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You're sure of this?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>With an expression that clearly says&mdash;I am telling the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me.</i>) Quite sure.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Nods once</i>) When did you do this thing?</p>

<p>SMITH. Five years ago.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. How old are you?</p>

<p>SMITH. Forty-seven.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Where were you the other forty-two years?</p>

<p>SMITH. I wasn't.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You mean you started out....</p>

<p>SMITH. Forty-two years old. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. But the world is millions of years old.</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Shaking his head</i>) No. It isn't.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. It's five years old.</p>

<p>SMITH. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What about fossils? What about the age of rocks? Uranium into
lead. What about diamonds?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Not to be bothered</i>) Illusions.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You made them up.</p>

<p>SMITH. That's....</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Breaking in</i>) Why?</p>

<p>SMITH. To see if I could.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. I don't....</p>

<p>SMITH. Anyone can make a world. It takes ingenuity to make one and then
make the people on it think that it's existed for millions of years.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. How long did all this take you?</p>

<p>SMITH. Three and a half months. World time.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>SMITH. Before I made the world I lived beyond time.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Where's that?</p>

<p>SMITH. No where.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. In the cosmos?</p>

<p>SMITH. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You didn't like it there?</p>

<p>SMITH. No. It was boring.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. And that's why....</p>

<p>SMITH. I made the world.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Yes. But ... how did you make it?</p>

<p>SMITH. I had books.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Books?</p>

<p>SMITH. Instruction books.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Where did you get them?</p>

<p>SMITH. I made them up.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You mean you wrote them?</p>

<p>SMITH. I ... made them up.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. How?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Mustache bristling truculently</i>) I made them up.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Lips pursed</i>) So there you were out in the cosmos with a
handful of books.</p>

<p>SMITH. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What if you had dropped them?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Chooses not to answer this patent absurdity</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Mister Smith.</p>

<p>SMITH. Yes?</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Who made you?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Shakes his head</i>) I don't know.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Were you always like this? (<i>He points at Mr. Smith's lowly
frame.</i>)</p>

<p>SMITH. I don't think so. I think that I was punished.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. For what?</p>

<p>SMITH. For making the world so complicated.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. I should think so.</p>

<p>SMITH. It's not my fault. I just made it, I didn't say it would work
right.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You just started your machine and then walked away.</p>

<p>SMITH. That's....</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Then what are you doing here?</p>

<p>SMITH. I told you. I think I've been punished.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Oh yes. For making it too complicated. I forgot.</p>

<p>SMITH. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Who punished you?</p>

<p>SMITH. I don't remember.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. That's convenient.</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Looks morose</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Might it be God?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Shrugs</i>) It might.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. He might have a few fingers in the rest of the Universe.</p>

<p>SMITH. He might. But I made the world.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Enough, Mr. Smith, you did not make the world.</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Insulted</i>) Yes, I did too.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. And you created me?</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Concedingly</i>) Indirectly.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Then uncreate me.</p>

<p>SMITH. I can't.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Why?</p>

<p>SMITH. I just started things. I don't control them now.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Sighs</i>) Then what are you worried about, Mr. Smith?</p>

<p>SMITH. I have a premonition.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What about?</p>

<p>SMITH. I'm going to die.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. So...?</p>

<p>SMITH. Someone has to take over. Or else.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Or else...?</p>

<p>SMITH. The whole world will go.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Go where?</p>

<p>SMITH. No where. Just disappear.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. How can it disappear if it works independently of you?</p>

<p>SMITH. It will be taken away to punish me.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You?</p>

<p>SMITH. Yes.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. You mean if you die, the entire world will disappear?</p>

<p>SMITH. That's correct.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. If I shot you, the instant you died I would disappear?</p>

<p>SMITH. That's....</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. I have advice.</p>

<p>SMITH. Yes? You will help?</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Go to see a reputable psychiatrist.</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Standing</i>) I should have known. I have no more to say.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. (<i>Shrugs</i>) As you will.</p>

<p>SMITH. I'll go but you'll be sorry about this.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. I dare say you are already sorry, Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>SMITH. Goodbye. (<i>Mr. Smith exits. Doctor Janishefsky calls for his
nurse over the interphone. Nurse Mudde enters.</i>)</p>

<p>NURSE M. Yes, doctor?</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Nurse Mudde, stand by the window and tell me what you see.</p>

<p>NURSE M. What I...?</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What you see. I want you to tell me what Mr. Smith does after
he comes out of the building.</p>

<p>NURSE M. (<i>Shrugs</i>) Yes, doctor. (<i>She goes to the window</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Has he come out yet?</p>

<p>NURSE M. No.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Keep watching.</p>

<p>NURSE M. There he is. He's stepping off the curb. He's walking across
the street.</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Yes.</p>

<p>NURSE M. He's stopping now in the middle of the street. He's turning.
He's looking up at this window. There's a look of ... of ...
<i>realization</i> on his face. He's coming back. (<i>She screams</i>) He's been
hit by a car. He's lying on the street....</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. What is it, Nurse Mudde?</p>

<p>Nurse M. (<i>Reeling</i>) Everything is ... is <i>fading</i>! Doctor Janishefsky,
it's fading! (<i>Another scream</i>)</p>

<p>DOCTOR J. Don't be absurd, Nurse Mudde. Look at me. Can you honestly
say that.... (<i>He stops talking. She cannot honestly say anything. She
is not there. Doctor Janishefsky who is not really Doctor Janishefsky
floats alone in the cosmos in his chair which is not really a chair.
He looks at the chair beside him.</i>) I hope you've learned your lesson.
I'm going to put your toy back but don't you dare go near it. So you're
bored are you? Scalliwag! You just behave yourself or I'll take away
your books too! (<i>He snorts</i>) So you made them up, did you? (He looks
around). How about picking them up, jackanapes!</p>

<p>SMITH. (<i>Who is not really Smith</i>) Yes, father.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
